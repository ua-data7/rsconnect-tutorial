## Background

RStudio Connect is a tool that allows for organizational sharing of items published from RStudio such as [Shiny apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), interactive graphs and reporting documents (such as this one created with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)). This document is intended to walk RStudio users through the process of establishing an account, connecting to RStudio Connect from RStudio and publishing a document to RStudio Connect.

## System Requirements

Posit Connect is supported on multiple operating systems and browsers. For a full list see documentation found [here](https://posit.co/about/platform-support/) to ensure full machine compatibility.
